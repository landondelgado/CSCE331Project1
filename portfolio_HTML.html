                    <p>As a computer engineer at IS4S, I utilized C++ extensively to develop test software which supported a major 
                        military software-defined radio contract. I took the initiative in designing and implementing software based 
                        on my own ideas, which allowed me to gain comprehensive experience in the software development lifecycle, 
                        from creating UML diagrams to implementing test cases and coding. During my time at IS4S, I gained crucial 
                        skills in C++ networking, Docker containerization for software portability, and pipelining in Git to consolidate 
                        team members' tests into a central location. The experience I gained was invaluable and has contributed greatly 
                        towards my future goals.</p>

                    <p>During my time as a lifeguard, I learned essential leadership skills in a position that focused 
                        on teamwork while ensuring public safety in a well-organized facility. I applied problem-solving 
                        skills to maintain proper working conditions with teammates and patrons in unique circumstances. 
                        This role required quick thinking and adaptability, as I was put in situations that required me to 
                        expand my linear thinking and develop out-of-the-box solutions for real-life problems in a time-constrained 
                        environment. My reliability as a lifeguard was valued and my employer will verify my dependability.</p>

                    <p>I studied Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, completing a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum which allowed me to 
                        expand my knowledge in both hardware and software systems. As an Aggie, I engaged in challenging coursework which covered topics 
                        ranging from digital logic design and computer architecture to software development and embedded systems. During my time at 
                        Texas A&M, I gained hands-on experience in software development and electrical circuit design, thanks to the advanced labs we 
                        had access to. I had the opportunity to work both independently and  in group environments, which developed my teamwork and 
                        communication skills, while also teaching me the benefits and drawbacks of each.
